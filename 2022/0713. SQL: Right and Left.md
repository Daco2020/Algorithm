You are given a table named repositories, format as below:

\*\* repositories table schema \*\*

-   project
-   commits
-   contributors
-   address

The table shows project names of major cryptocurrencies, their numbers of commits and contributors and also a random donation address ( not linked in any way :) ).

For each row: Return first x characters of the project name where x = commits. Return last y characters of each address where y = contributors.

Return project and address columns only, as follows:

\*\* output table schema \*\*

-   project
-   address

Case should be maintained.

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  LEFT(project, commits) AS project,
  RIGHT(address, contributors) AS address 
FROM 
  repositories
```

## Result:
