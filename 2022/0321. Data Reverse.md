## Description:

A stream of data is received and needs to be reversed.

Each segment is 8 bits long, meaning the order of these segments needs to be reversed, for example:

```
11111111  00000000  00001111  10101010
 (byte1)   (byte2)   (byte3)   (byte4)
```

should become:

```
10101010  00001111  00000000  11111111
 (byte4)   (byte3)   (byte2)   (byte1)
```

The total number of bits will always be a multiple of 8.

The data is given in an array as such:

```
[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0]
```

Note: In the C and NASM languages you are given the third parameter which is the number of segment blocks.

## Solution:

1\. 배열을 8로 나눈 수만큼 반복한다.

2\. 뒤에서부터 8개 요소씩 배열로 만든다.

3\. 하나의 배열로 합쳐 반환한다.

```
def data_reverse(data):
    return sum([data[i*-8:] if i == 1 else data[i*-8:(i-1)*-8] for i in range(1, len(data)//8+1)],[])
```

## Best Practices:

```
def data_reverse(data):
    return sum([data[i:i+8] for i in range(len(data)-8, -1, -8)],[])
```
