Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".  
If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

```
name + " plays banjo" 
name + " does not play banjo"
```

Names given are always valid strings.

## Solution:

1\. Check if the first letter of 'name' is 'r'.  
2\. If it is 'r', make the sentence " plays banjo".  
3\. If it is not 'r', make a sentence "does not play banjo".  
4. After name, the created sentence is attached and returned.

```
def are_you_playing_banjo(name):
    return name + (name[:1].lower() == "r" and " plays" or " does not play") + " banjo"
```
