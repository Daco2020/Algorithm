For this challenge you need to create a simple HAVING statement, you want to count how many people have the same age and return the groups with 10 or more people who have that age.

### people table schema

-   id
-   name
-   age

### return table schema

-   age
-   total\_people

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  age,
  COUNT(age) AS total_people
FROM 
  people
GROUP BY
  age
HAVING
  COUNT(age) >= 10
```

## Result:

| age | total\_people |
| --- | --- |
| 16 | 13 |
| 54 | 11 |
| 47 | 14 |
| 99 | 11 |
| 46 | 20 |
