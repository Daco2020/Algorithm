## Description:

After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

## Solution:

1\. Multiply 40 by the number of 'd'.  
2\. If the number of 'd' is 7 or more, subtract 50 and return it.  
3\. If the number of 'd' is 3 or more, subtract 20 and return it.

```
def rental_car_cost(d):
    cost = d * 40
    discount = {
        True:50, False:{
        True:20, False:0
        }[d >= 3]
    }[d >= 7]
    return cost - discount
```

This time, I deliberately used a dictionary to solve it.  
I was able to solve the two branches into a dictionary without using if.

Actually, this problem can be solved more simply.  
For a simpler solution, refer to the code below.

```
def rental_car_cost(d):
  return d * 40 - (d > 2) * 20 - (d > 6) * 30
```
