For this challenge you need to create a SELECT statement that will contain data about departments that had a sale with a price over 98.00 dollars. This SELECT statement will have to use an EXISTS to achieve the task.

### departments table schema

-   id
-   name

### sales table schema

-   id
-   department\_id (department foreign key)
-   name
-   price
-   card\_name
-   card\_number
-   transaction\_date

### resultant table schema

-   id
-   name

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
 departments.id, 
 departments.name 
FROM 
  departments 
WHERE
  EXISTS(
    SELECT 
      * 
    FROM 
      sales 
    WHERE 
      sales.department_id = departments.id
      and sales.price >= 98.00
  )
```

## Result:

| id | name |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Shoes |
| 2 | Clothing |
| 3 | Jewelry |
| 4 | Tools |
