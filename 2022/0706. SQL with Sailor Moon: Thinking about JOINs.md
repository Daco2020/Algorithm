Return a results table - sailor\_senshi, real\_name, cat and school \- of all characters, containing each character's high school, their civilian name and the cat who introduced them to their magical crime-fighting destiny.

Keep in mind some senshi were not initiated by a cat guardian and one is not in high school. The field can be left blank if this is the case.

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  senshi_name AS sailor_senshi,
  real_name_jpn AS real_name,
  cats.name AS cat,
  schools.school
FROM 
  sailorsenshi AS s
LEFT OUTER JOIN schools ON s.school_id = schools.id
LEFT OUTER JOIN cats ON s.cat_id = cats.id
```
