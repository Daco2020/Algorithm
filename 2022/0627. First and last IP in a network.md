## Task

Given a table where users' connections are logged, find the first and the last address of the networks they connected from.

## Notes

-   Order the result by the id column
-   There's no need to validate anything - it's okay if the user connects from a private network
-   (You don't need the connection\_time field for this task but without it the input data looks too dull)
-   You can read more about IPv4 [on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4) (check the [First and last subnet addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4#First_and_last_subnet_addresses) section if you need an example/explanation related to this task only)

## Input table

```
---------------------------------------------
|    Table    |     Column      |   Type    |
|-------------+-----------------+-----------|
| connections | id              | int       |
|             | connection_time | timestamp |
|             | ip_address      | inet      |
---------------------------------------------
```

## Output table

```
------------------------
|    Column     | Type |
|---------------+------|
| id            | int  |
| first_address | text |
| last_address  | text |
------------------------
```

### Example

For the IP address 182.240.42.115/24 the first address in the network is 182.240.42.0/24, and the last one is 182.240.42.255/24.

## Solution:

```
SELECT
  id,
  NETWORK(ip_address) AS first_address,
  BROADCAST(ip_address) AS last_address
FROM connections
ORDER BY id
```

broadcast(inet) is broadcast address for network -> 192.168.1.255/24

network(inet) is extract network part of address -> 192.168.1.0/24

 [Network Address Functions and Operators

Table 9-34 shows the operators available for the cidr and inet types. The operators <<, <<=, >>, and >>= test for subnet inclusion. They consider only the network parts of the two addresses (ignoring any host part) and determine whether one network is iden
