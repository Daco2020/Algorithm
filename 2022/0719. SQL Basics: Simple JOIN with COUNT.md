or this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table, and join to the toys table so that you can return the COUNT of the toys

### people table schema

-   id
-   name

### toys table schema

-   id
-   name
-   people\_id

You should return all people fields as well as the toy count as "toy\_count".

## Solution:

```
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.name,
  COUNT(t.name) AS toy_count 
FROM 
  people p
JOIN 
  toys t 
  ON 
    p.id = t.people_id
GROUP BY
  p.id
```

## Result:

| id | name | toy\_count |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2 | Baumbach, Greenfelder and Nader | 4 |
| 1 | Harvey, Moen and Considine | 6 |
