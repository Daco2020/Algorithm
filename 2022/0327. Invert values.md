## Description:

Given a set of numbers, return the additive inverse of each. Each positive becomes negatives, and the negatives become positives.

```
invert([1,2,3,4,5]) == [-1,-2,-3,-4,-5]
invert([1,-2,3,-4,5]) == [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
invert([]) == []
```

You can assume that all values are integers. Do not mutate the input array/list.

## Solution:

1\. Get the numbers in the array.  
2\. Change positive numbers to negative numbers.  
3\. Change negative numbers to positive numbers.  
4. Return the changed array.

```
def invert(lst):
    return [-i for i in lst]
```
