You have access to a table of monsters as follows:

**monsters schema**

-   id
-   name
-   legs
-   arms
-   characteristics

In each row, the characteristic column has a single comma. Your job is to find it using position(). You must return a table with the format as follows:

**output schema**

-   id
-   name
-   comma

The comma column will contain the position of the comma within the characteristics string. Order the results by comma.

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  id,
  name,
  POSITION(',' in characteristics) AS comma
FROM
  monsters
ORDER BY 
  comma;
```

POSITION is a function that returns an index after checking whether a string is included in the corresponding column.

## Result:

| id | name | comma |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9 | Random | 1 |
| 7 | Random | 3 |
| 5 | Martin | 4 |
| 1 | Cyril | 4 |
| 6 | Random | 4 |
| 2 | Tiny | 6 |
