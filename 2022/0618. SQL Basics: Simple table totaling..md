For this challenge you need to create a simple query to display each unique clan with their total points and ranked by their total points.

### people table schema

-   name
-   points
-   clan

You should then return a table that resembles below

### select on

-   rank
-   clan
-   total\_points
-   total\_people

The query must rank each clan by their total\_points, you must return each unqiue clan and if there is no clan name (i.e. it's an empty string) you must replace it with \[no clan specified\], you must sum the total\_points for each clan and the total\_people within that clan.

## Solution:

```
SELECT
  RANK () OVER (ORDER BY SUM(points) DESC),
  CASE WHEN clan = '' THEN '[no clan specified]' ELSE clan END,
  SUM(points) as total_points,
  COUNT(name) as total_people
FROM 
  people
GROUP BY clan
```

## Result:

| rank | clan | total\_points | total\_people |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | \[no clan specified\] | 2398178 | 44 |
| 2 | none | 387976 | 1 |
| 3 | codewars | 344611 | 3 |
| 4 | 中国 长垣 | 284525 | 1 |
| 5 | freecodecamp | 258436 | 1 |
