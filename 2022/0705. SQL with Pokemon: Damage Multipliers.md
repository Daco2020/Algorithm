You have arrived at the Celadon Gym to battle Erika for the Rainbow Badge.

She will be using Grass-type Pokemon. Any fire pokemon you have will be strong against grass, but your water types will be weakened. The multipliers table within your Pokedex will take care of that.

Using the following tables, return the pokemon\_name, modifiedStrength and element of the Pokemon whose strength, after taking these changes into account, is greater than or equal to 40, ordered from strongest to weakest.

pokemon schema

-   id
-   pokemon\_name
-   element\_id
-   str

multipliers schema

-   id
-   element
-   multiplier

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  p.pokemon_name,
  p.str*m.multiplier AS modifiedstrength, 
  m.element 
FROM 
  pokemon AS p 
    JOIN 
      multipliers AS m 
      ON p.element_id = m.id
WHERE 
  p.str*m.multiplier >= 40 
ORDER BY modifiedstrength DESC
```

## Result:

| pokemon\_name | modifiedstrength | element |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vulpix | 51.25 | Fire |
| Weezing | 48.75 | Fire |
| Clefairy | 47.5 | Fire |
| Dratini | 45 | Fire |
| Venomoth | 43.75 | Fire |
| Magneton | 43.75 | Fire |
| Koffing | 43 | Grass |
| Tentacool | 43 | Normal |
| Electrode | 42 | Grass |
| Kangaskhan | 40 | Normal |
