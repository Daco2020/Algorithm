You are working for a local school, and you are responsible for collecting tuition from students. You have a list of all students, some of them have already paid tution and some haven't. Write a select statement to get a list of all students who haven't paid their tuition yet. The list should include all the data available about these students.

students table schema

-   name (string)
-   age (integer)
-   semester (integer)
-   mentor (string)
-   tuition\_received (Boolean)

NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases just to validate your answer.

## Solution:

```
SELECT *
FROM students
WHERE NOT tuition_received;
```

When checking true and false values, there is no need to use '='('==') like in python.
