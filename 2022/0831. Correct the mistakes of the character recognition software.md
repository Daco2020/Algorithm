Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

S is misinterpreted as 5
O is misinterpreted as 0
I is misinterpreted as 1
The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.

## Solution:

```py
def replace(func):
    def wrapper(s):
        return func(i.isdigit() and {"0":"O","1":"I","5":"S"}[i] or i for i in s)
    return wrapper

@replace
def correct(arr):
    return ''.join(arr)
```

## Other Solution:

```py
def correct(string):
    return string.translate(str.maketrans("501", "SOI"))
```

<br>

```py
def correct(string):
    return string.replace('1','I').replace('0','O').replace('5','S')
```
