Given a demographics table in the following format:

\*\* demographics table schema \*\*

-   id
-   name
-   birthday
-   race

you need to return the same table where all text fields (name & race) are changed to the ascii code of their first byte.

e.g. Verlie = 86 Warren = 87 Horace = 72 Tracy = 84

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  id, 
  ASCII(name) AS name, 
  birthday, 
  ASCII(race) AS race 
FROM 
  demographics
```

## Result:

| id | name | birthday | race |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 68 | 2000-01-25 | 78 |
| 2 | 75 | 1978-06-17 | 65 |
| 3 | 76 | 1966-03-03 | 65 |
| 4 | 67 | 1963-08-20 | 65 |
| 5 | 74 | 1961-05-14 | 78 |
| 6 | 77 | 1974-04-13 | 65 |
