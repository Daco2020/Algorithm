For this challenge you need to create a basic Increment function which Increments on the age field of the peoples table.

The function should be called increment, it needs to take 1 integer and increment that number by 1.

You may query the people table while testing but the query must only contain the function on your final submit.

## important: you must remove all comments when submitting the kata.

### people table schema

-   id
-   name
-   age

> NOTE: Your solution should use PL/SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.  
>   

## Solution:

```
CREATE FUNCTION increment(n int) 
RETURNS 
  int AS $$
  BEGIN 
    RETURN n+1;
  END;

$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```
