Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

## Solution:

```
def high(x):
    x = x.lower().split(" ")
    points = [sum([ord(i)-ord("a")+1 for i in j]) for j in x]
    return x[points.index(max(points))]
```
