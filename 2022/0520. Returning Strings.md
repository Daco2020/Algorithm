Write a select statement that takes name from person table and return "Hello, how are you doing today?" results in a column named greeting

\[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly\]

## Solution:

```
SELECT concat('Hello, ', name, ' how are you doing today?') 
AS greeting 
FROM person
```

concat appends string arguments.

'||' By using symbols, the same result can be achieved.

```
SELECT 'Hello, ' || name || ' how are you doing today?' 
AS greeting 
FROM person
```

## Result:

| greeting |
| --- |
| Hello, Tim DuBuque how are you doing today? |
| Hello, Jessie Hodkiewicz how are you doing today? |
| Hello, Casandra Blick LLD how are you doing today? |
| Hello, Mrs. Don Stiedemann how are you doing today? |
