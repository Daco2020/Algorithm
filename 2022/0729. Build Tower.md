## Build Tower

Build a pyramid-shaped tower given a positive integer number of floors. A tower block is represented with "\*" character.

For example, a tower with 3 floors looks like this:

```
[
  "  *  ",
  " *** ", 
  "*****"
]
```

And a tower with 6 floors looks like this:

```
[
  "     *     ", 
  "    ***    ", 
  "   *****   ", 
  "  *******  ", 
  " ********* ", 
  "***********"
]
```

## Solution:

```
def tower_builder(n_floors):
    nums = [i>0 and i*2+1 or 1 for i in range(n_floors)]
    return [(i*"*").center(max(nums)) for i in nums]
```

## Best Practice:

```
def tower_builder(n):
    return [("*" * (i*2-1)).center(n*2-1) for i in range(1, n+1)]
```
