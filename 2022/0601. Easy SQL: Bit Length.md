Given a demographics table in the following format:

\*\* demographics table schema \*\*

-   id
-   name
-   birthday
-   race

you need to return the same table where all text fields (name & race) are changed to the bit length of the string.

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
    id, 
    BIT_LENGTH(name) AS name,
    birthday, 
    BIT_LENGTH(race) AS race
FROM 
    demographics
```

## Result:

| id | name | birthday | race |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 40 | 1983-01-30 | 200 |
| 2 | 40 | 1974-09-15 | 200 |
| 3 | 40 | 1962-05-18 | 328 |
| 4 | 64 | 1971-07-07 | 40 |
| 5 | 56 | 1991-09-12 | 40 |
| 6 | 64 | 1961-11-02 | 328 |
