You will need to create SELECT statement in conjunction with LIKE.

Please list people which have first\_name with at least 6 character long

### names table schema

-   id
-   first\_name
-   last\_name

### results table schema

-   first\_name
-   last\_name

## Solution:

SELECT 
  first_name, 
  last_name 
FROM 
  names 
WHERE 
  first_name LIKE '______%'
