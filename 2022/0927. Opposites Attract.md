Timmy & Sarah think they are in love, but around where they live, they will only know once they pick a flower each. If one of the flowers has an even number of petals and the other has an odd number of petals it means they are in love.

Write a function that will take the number of petals of each flower and return true if they are in love and false if they aren't.

## Solution:

```py
from typing import List


def get_arr(func):
    def wrapper(*args):
        return func([*args])
    return wrapper

@get_arr
def lovefunc(flowers: List[int]) -> bool:
    return sum(flowers) % 2
```
