## Description:

# The museum of incredible dull things

The museum of incredible dull things wants to get rid of some exhibitions. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibitions. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

However, just as she finished rating all exhibitions, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the items after one removed the lowest one. Fair enough.

# Task

Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. **Do not mutate the original array/list**. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with a lower index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.

Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

### Examples

```
* Input: [1,2,3,4,5], output= [2,3,4,5]
* Input: [5,3,2,1,4], output = [5,3,2,4]
* Input: [2,2,1,2,1], output = [2,2,2,1]
```

## Solution:

1\. If the input array is an empty array, it is returned as is.  
2\. Copy the original array.  
3. Returns an array after subtracting the minimum value from the copied array.

```
def remove_smallest(numbers):
    arr = numbers[:]
    return numbers and arr.pop(arr.index(min(arr))) and arr
```

The problem is that the original array should not be changed, so you have to copy the input array and use it.
