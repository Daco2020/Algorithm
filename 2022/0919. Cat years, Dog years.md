## Kata Task

I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]


### NOTES:

- humanYears >= 1
- humanYears are whole numbers only

### Cat Years
- 15 cat years for first year
- +9 cat years for second year
- +4 cat years for each year after that

### Dog Years
- 15 dog years for first year
- +9 dog years for second year
- +5 dog years for each year after that

## Solution:

```py
CAT_INTERVAL = 4
DOG_INTERVAL = 5


def human_years_cat_years_dog_years(years):
    cat_years = _get_years(CAT_INTERVAL, years)
    dog_years = _get_years(DOG_INTERVAL, years)
    return [years, cat_years, dog_years]

def _get_years(interval, years):
    age_table = {1: 15, 2: 24}
    age_table.update({i: (i-2)*interval + 24 for i in range(3, years+1)})
    return age_table[years]
```
