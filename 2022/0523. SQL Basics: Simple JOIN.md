For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the products table, and join to the companies table so that you can return the company name.

### products table schema

-   id
-   name
-   isbn
-   company\_id
-   price

### companies table schema

-   id
-   name

You should return all product fields as well as the company name as "company\_name".

> NOTE: Your solution should use pure SQL. Ruby is used within the test cases to do the actual testing.

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  PD.id, 
  PD.name, 
  PD.isbn, 
  PD.company_id, 
  PD.price, 
  CP.name AS company_name 
FROM products AS PD
LEFT JOIN companies AS CP 
ON PD.company_id = CP.id
```

If solved differently,

```
SELECT p.*,
       c.name AS company_name
  FROM products p,
       companies c
 WHERE c.id = p.company_id
```

## Result:
