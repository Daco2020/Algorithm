Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".

Note: for this kata y isn't considered a vowel.

## Solution:

1\. Check if there is a vowel among the characters of string.  
2. Returns all characters except vowels.

```
def disemvowel(string_):
    return ''.join([string_[i] for i, v in enumerate(string_.lower()) if v not in "aeiou"])
```

## Best Practice:

```
def disemvowel(string):
    return string.translate(None, 'aeiouAEIOU')
```
