## Description:

You get an array of arrays.  
If you sort the arrays by their length, you will see, that their length-values are consecutive.  
But one array is missing!  
  
  
You have to write a method, that return the length of the missing array.

```
Example:
[[1, 2], [4, 5, 1, 1], [1], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]] --> 3
```

  

If the array of arrays is null/nil or empty, the method should return 0.

When an array in the array is null or empty, the method should return 0 too!  
There will always be a missing element and its length will be always between the given arrays.  
  
Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)  
  
I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.

## Solution:

1\. If there is a false value in the array, 0 is returned.  
2\. Count the number of elements in the list in the array and put them in the 'arr' array.  
3\. Sort the 'arr' array, find an empty number and return it.

```
def get_length_of_missing_array(array):
    arr = array and all(array) and sorted(list(map(len, array)))
    return [v-1 for i, v in enumerate(arr) if arr[0] != v-i][0] if arr else 0
```

The all() function returns True only if all elements in the array are True.  
The any() function returns True if at least one element in the array is True.
