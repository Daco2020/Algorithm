For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table, and join to the sales table so that you can return the COUNT of all sales and RANK each person by their sale\_count.

### people table schema

-   id
-   name

### sales table schema

-   id
-   people\_id
-   sale
-   price

You should return all people fields as well as the sale count as "sale\_count" and the rank as "sale\_rank".

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  p.id, 
  p.name, 
  COUNT(s.sale) AS sale_count,
  RANK () OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(s.sale)) AS sale_rank 
FROM 
  people p
  JOIN sales s ON s.people_id = p.id 
GROUP BY p.id
```

## Result:

| id | name | sale\_count | sale\_rank |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
