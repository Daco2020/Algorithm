Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

### Examples (Input -> Output):

```
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
```

Good Luck!

## Solution:

```py
def double_char(s: str) -> str:
    return "".join((lambda x: x+x)(i) for i in s)
```
