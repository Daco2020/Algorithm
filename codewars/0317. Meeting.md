## Description:

John has invited some friends. His list is:

```
s = "Fred:Corwill;Wilfred:Corwill;Barney:Tornbull;Betty:Tornbull;Bjon:Tornbull;Raphael:Corwill;Alfred:Corwill";
```

Could you make a program that

-   makes this string uppercase
-   gives it sorted in alphabetical order by last name.

When the last names are the same, sort them by first name. Last name and first name of a guest come in the result between parentheses separated by a comma.

So the result of function meeting(s) will be:

```
"(CORWILL, ALFRED)(CORWILL, FRED)(CORWILL, RAPHAEL)(CORWILL, WILFRED)(TORNBULL, BARNEY)(TORNBULL, BETTY)(TORNBULL, BJON)"
```

It can happen that in two distinct families with the same family name two people have the same first name too.

#### Notes

-   You can see another examples in the "Sample tests".

## Solution:

1\. Create a two-dimensional array of names in a string.  
2\. Sort the two-dimensional array.  
3. Converts to a string and returns it.

```
def meeting(s):
    split_arr = [i.upper().split(':') for i in s.split(';')]
    sorted_arr = sorted(split_arr, key=lambda x:(x[1], x[0]))
    return ''.join([f"({i[1]}, {i[0]})" for i in sorted_arr])
```

Best Practices:

```
def meeting(s):
    names = s.upper().split(';')
    return ''.join(sorted('({1}, {0})'.format(*(n.split(':'))) for n in names))
```

```
def meeting(s):
    return ''.join(f'({a}, {b})' for a, b in sorted(name.split(':')[::-1] for name in s.upper().split(';')))
```
