Alex just got a new hula hoop, he loves it but feels discouraged because his little brother is better than him

Write a program where Alex can input (n) how many times the hoop goes round and it will return him an encouraging message :)

- If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
- If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

## Solution:

```py
from functools import lru_cache


def hoop_count(n: int) -> str:
    select = n >= 10 and 1 or 0
    return _get_encouraging_message(select)

@lru_cache(maxsize=2)
def _get_encouraging_message(select: int) -> str:
    return {
        1 : "Great, now move on to tricks", 
        0 : "Keep at it until you get it"
    }[select]
```
