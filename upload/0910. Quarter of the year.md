Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

## Solution:
```py
def quarter_of(month):
    return (lambda x: x%3==0 and x//3 or x//3+1)(month)
```

<br>

## Other Solution:
```py
from math import ceil

def quarter_of(month):
    return ceil(month / 3)
```

```py
def quarter_of(month):
    return (month + 2) // 3
```

```py
def quarter_of(month):
    return (month-1) // 3 + 1 
```
