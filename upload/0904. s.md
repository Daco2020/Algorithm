Numbers ending with zeros are boring.

They might be fun in your world, but not here.

Get rid of them. Only the ending ones.

```
1450 -> 145
960000 -> 96
1050 -> 105
-1050 -> -105
```

Zero alone is fine, don't worry about it. Poor guy anyway

## Solution:

```py
def remove_zero(func):
    def wrapper(n: int):
        s = str(n).rstrip("0")
        return func(s)
    return wrapper
    
@remove_zero
def no_boring_zeros(s: str):
    return s and int(s) or 0
```
