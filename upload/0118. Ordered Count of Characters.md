Count the number of occurrences of each character and return it as a (list of tuples) in order of appearance. For empty output return (an empty list).

Consult the solution set-up for the exact data structure implementation depending on your language.

Example:

```
ordered_count("abracadabra") == [('a', 5), ('b', 2), ('r', 2), ('c', 1), ('d', 1)]
```

# Solution:
```py
def ordered_count(inp):
    from collections import Counter
    count_dict = Counter(list(inp))
    return [tuple for tuple in zip(count_dict.keys(), count_dict.values())]
```

```py
from collections import Counter

def ordered_count(inp):
    return list(Counter(inp).items())
```
