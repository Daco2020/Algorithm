Clock shows h hours, m minutes and s seconds after midnight.

Your task is to write a function which returns the time since midnight in milliseconds.

## Example:

```
h = 0
m = 1
s = 1

result = 61000
```


## Input constraints:

- 0 <= h <= 23
- 0 <= m <= 59
- 0 <= s <= 59

<br><br>

## Solution:
```dart
int past(int h, int m, int s) {
  int hm = h*60+m;
  int ms = hm*60+s;
  int result = ms*1000;
  return result;
}
```
