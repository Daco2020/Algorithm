I will give you an integer. Give me back a shape that is as long and wide as the integer. The integer will be a whole number between 1 and 50.

## Example

n = 3, so I expect a 3x3 square back just like below as a string:

```
+++
+++
+++
```

## Solution:
```py
def generate_shape(n: int) -> str:
    return "\n".join("+" * n for i in range(n))
```
