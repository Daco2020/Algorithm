## Description:

### A square of squares

You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

### Task

Given an integral number, determine if it's a [square number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number):

> In mathematics, a **square number** or **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

### Examples

```
-1  =>  false
 0  =>  true
 3  =>  false
 4  =>  true
25  =>  true
26  =>  false
```

## Solution:

1\. Find the root value of 'n'.  
2. Returns true if the root value is a positive integer, false otherwise.

```
var isSquare = function(n){
    return Number.isInteger(Math.sqrt(n))
}
```

Math.sqrt() is a method to find the root value.  
Number.isInteger() is a method that finds a positive integer.
