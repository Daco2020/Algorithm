Complete the function, which calculates how much you need to tip based on the total amount of the bill and the service.

You need to consider the following ratings:

- Terrible: tip 0%
- Poor: tip 5%
- Good: tip 10%
- Great: tip 15%
- Excellent: tip 20%

The rating is case insensitive (so "great" = "GREAT"). If an unrecognised rating is received, then you need to return:

- "Rating not recognised" in Javascript, Python and Ruby...
- ...or null in Java
- ...or -1 in C#

Because you're a nice person, you always round up the tip, regardless of the service.

## Solution:
```py
tip_table = {
    "terrible": 0,
    "poor": 0.05,
    "good": 0.1,
    "great": 0.15,
    "excellent": 0.2,
}

def calculate_tip(amount: float, rating: str, tip_table: dict[str, float] = tip_table) -> str | int:
    tip_rate = tip_table.get(rating.lower())
    if tip_rate is None:
        return 'Rating not recognised'
    import math
    return math.ceil(amount * tip_rate)
```
